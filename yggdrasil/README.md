# What is it?
This is a Home Assistant addon, that will add for your home assistant full Yggdrasil functionality.
You will have static IP, will work incoming connections and local peer discovery.

# How to setup?
Just install and run addon, no additional configuration requied!

# Get IP
Open logs, scroll to the up and find IP after "Yggdrasil IP:"

# Security warning
All ports of HA will be available for **everyone** in Yggdrasil. Set strong passwords.

Maybe, sometime I will implement IP whitelist support.

# Thanks
